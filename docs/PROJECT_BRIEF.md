# Co-ventures — Project Brief (V1)

## What this product is
Co-ventures is a real estate investing website focused on helping investors explore curated opportunities in India's growth corridors.
This is a marketing site + listings-style browsing experience (for now).

## What this product is NOT (V1)
- Not a co-housing / co-ownership platform
- Not a consumer "find your dream home" website
- No AI/agent feature in V1 (we will add later)
- No claims of guaranteed returns or "assured" outcomes

## Primary goal
Make Co-ventures look and feel institutional, premium, and trustworthy — like an investment firm.
Drive inquiries and conversations via Contact / Schedule a Call.

## Target audience
- Investors and HNIs looking at Indian real estate
- NRIs / global Indians evaluating India growth markets
- People who want structured evaluation and clarity (not hype)

## Brand voice
- Confident, calm, professional
- Plain English, no jargon-heavy hype
- "Capital-first, discipline-first, clarity-first"

## Messaging pillars
1. India growth corridors + demand fundamentals
2. Disciplined underwriting and risk management
3. Transparent process and clean documentation standards
4. Long-term, thesis-driven investing

## Design principles
- Minimal, clean, enterprise-oriented
- Neutral palette, one accent color
- Consistent spacing rhythm and typography hierarchy
- Subtle UI (borders > shadows, no loud gradients)

## CTAs
Primary: Explore Opportunities / Get in Touch
Secondary: Our Strategy / Schedule a Call

## Legal/disclaimer guidance
Use light disclaimers site-wide:
- "Informational only"
- "Not an offer or solicitation"
- "Investing involves risk"
Avoid performance claims unless verified and approved.

## Implementation notes
