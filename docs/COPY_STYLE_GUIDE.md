# Co-ventures — Copy & Style Guide

## Voice & Tone
- **Confident & institutional**: Write like an investment firm, not a consumer marketplace
- **Clear & direct**: Use plain English; avoid marketing hype or jargon overload
- **Measured & transparent**: Acknowledge risk, emphasize discipline and process over promises

## Preferred Words & Phrases
Use these to reinforce our investment positioning:
- "Curated opportunities"
- "Disciplined underwriting"
- "Risk-managed" / "risk-aware"
- "India's growth corridors"
- "Demand fundamentals"
- "Thesis-driven investing"
- "Transparent process"
- "Long-term capital deployment"
- "Structured evaluation"
- "Institutional-grade due diligence"

## Words & Phrases to Avoid
These signal the wrong model (co-housing, consumer real estate, or unrealistic promises):
- ❌ "Guaranteed returns"
- ❌ "Assured income"
- ❌ "Risk-free"
- ❌ "Double your money"
- ❌ "Dream home"
- ❌ "Co-ownership" / "co-housing"
- ❌ "Fractional ownership"
- ❌ "Affordable housing"
- ❌ "Luxury living"
- ❌ Over-the-top superlatives: "incredible", "amazing", "unbelievable"

## CTA Wording Rules
### Primary CTAs (main conversion points)
- "Explore Opportunities"
- "Get in Touch"
- "Schedule a Call"

### Secondary CTAs (navigation/education)
- "Our Strategy"
- "View Portfolio"
- "Learn More"

**Rule**: Keep CTAs action-oriented but professional. Avoid urgency language like "Act Now!" or "Limited Time!"

## Risk & Disclaimer Patterns
Use these concise, reusable disclaimer lines throughout the site:

**Standard site-wide footer/legal note:**
> "Information provided is for educational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or solicitation. All real estate investments involve risk, including potential loss of capital."

**On opportunity/listing pages:**
> "Past performance or projections are not indicative of future results. Conduct independent due diligence."

**On financial/performance mentions:**
> "Returns are not guaranteed. Market conditions may vary."

**General tone**: Professional and protective, but not overly paranoid. One sentence per context is sufficient.

## Example Rewrites

### Before (co-housing style):
> "Find your dream home and co-own premium properties with like-minded people. Affordable luxury living starts here!"

### After (Co-ventures style):
> "Explore curated real estate opportunities in India's high-growth corridors. Disciplined investing for long-term capital appreciation."

---

### Before (co-housing style):
> "Join our community of co-owners and unlock exclusive access to beautiful shared spaces."

### After (Co-ventures style):
> "Access institutional-grade investment opportunities with transparent underwriting and structured deal flow."

---

### Before (co-housing style):
> "Guaranteed returns! Double your money in 3 years with our risk-free co-ownership model."

### After (Co-ventures style):

## Application Notes
- Replace all existing copy referencing "co-housing", "co-ownership", or consumer lifestyle language
- Maintain consistency across all pages: Home, Strategy, Opportunities, Services, Contact
- When in doubt, default to the tone of an investment memo or institutional pitch deck
- Prioritize clarity and credibility over clever marketing copy
